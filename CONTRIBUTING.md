Zephyr members are invited to contribute in two ways:

1. If you’re already included on our list, go out and put GitHub stars on projects you 
use or like.  
2. You can propose additions to the list of known users—either by 
adding yourself, or by adding respected colleagues working in our industry.  You can do 
so by making a 
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
If you’re not familiar with Git, this is your opportunity 
to learn a bit how to use it.  For a simple repository update like this, you can do it 
entirely on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and you don’t even need to download or 
install anything (although you’ll certainly want to eventually if you want to really 
use Git).
