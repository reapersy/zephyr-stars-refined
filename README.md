# Zephyr Stars Refined

This refined project provides an improved and concise tabulation of GitHub projects that have been 'starred' multiple times by the members and friends of the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrtransport.org). A 'star' to different people can hold a diverse range of meanings. However, the high-ranked GitHub projects in this list (i.e., starred by a multitude of analytic transportation professionals) are anticipated to be predominately beneficial work tools.

If you are a member of Zephyr and wish inclusion in this refined project or would like to propose other significant industry professionals, kindly submit a *pull request* to add names (real names and GitHub user names, as shown) in the `known-users.yml` file.

The tabulation list of stars is displayed in the `STARS.md` file, and that file is auto synced to the ['stars' page on the Zephyr website](https://zephyrtransport.org/stars/). Please refrain from dir
